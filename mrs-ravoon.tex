\poemtitle{Alternative Endings to an Unwritten Ballad}
\poemauthor{Paul Dehn (1912--1979)}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

\begin{rverse*}
I stole through the dungeons, while everyone slept, \\*
Till I came to the cage where the Monster was kept. \\*
There, locked in the arms of a Giant Baboon, \\*
Rigid and smiling, lay \ldots{} \ravoon{}! \\!
\end{rverse*}

\begin{rverse*}
I climbed the clock-tower in the first morning sun \\*
And 'twas midday at least ere my journey was done; \\*
But the clock never sounded the last stroke of noon, \\*
For there, from the clapper, swung \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse*}

\begin{rverse*}
I hauled in the line, and I took my first look \\*
At the half-eaten horror that hung from the hook. \\*
I had dragged from the depths of the limpid lagoon \\*
The luminous body of \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse*}

\begin{rverse*}
I fled in the storm, thorough lightning and thunder, \\*
And there, as a flash split the darkness asunder, \\*
Chewing a rat's-tail and mumbling a rune, \\*
Mad in the moat squatted \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse*}

\begin{rverse*}
I stood by the waters so green and so thick, \\*
And I stirred at the scum with my old, withered stick; \\*
When there rose through the ooze, like a monstrous balloon, \\*
The bloated cadaver of \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse*}

\begin{rverse*}
Facing the fens, I looked back from the shore \\*
Where all had been empty a moment before; \\*
And there, by the light of the Lincolnshire moon, \\*
Immense on the marshes, stood \dots{} \ravoon{}! \\!
\end{rverse*}

\begin{rverse}[un]
Yesterday's fight saw her punched on the jaw \\
We knew she'd be angry, and probably sore --- \\
The swelling looked much like a weather balloon \\
Obscuring the features of \ravoon{} \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[gd]
The orchestra cuts are not a success. \\*
They've saved us some money, but Oh what a mess! \\*
The first violin and second bassoon \\*
must be played at the same time by \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[gd]
``You're a clever, unprincipled, self-serving liar, \\*
You're a confident, ruthless, ambitious high-flier, \\*
You're charming, you're mad, you can play the buffoon, \\*
You should go into politics MRS RAVOON!'' \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[nh]
She stood by a tree trunk, with pistol in hand, \\*
And there in the jungle she made her last stand, \\*
Facing fierce warriors of far Cameroon \\*
Defiant and dauntless stood \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[ad]
The narcotics cartels, both US and Hispanic \\*
Were shaking with fear that bordered on panic, \\*
For the drug dealer's murder in downtown Canc\'un \\*
Bore the grizzly callsign of \ravoon{}.
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[gd]
It seemed that the robber had run out of luck. \\*
The getaway quad bike had hit a big truck \\*
There in the wall, just like in a cartoon \\*
Was a hole in the shape of \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[gd]
Round the rim of the object appeared a thin crack \\*
Recalling `The Alien' I took a step back: \\*
There in the darkness from a fibrous cocoon \\*
Emerged the first larval instar of \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[jm]
``She's awa'!'' cried McTavish ``She left wi' the tide \\*
Wi' the brave wee girl rowin' an' Prince Charlie beside; \\*
For the hopes o' oor nation and the fate o' oor croon \\*
All gae wi' the lassie called \ravoon{}.'' \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[un]
Although she had told him he was totally wrong \\
He would not desist from his passionate song \\
The poor lovelorn gypsy continued to croon \\
hopeless sweet nothings to \ravoon{} \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[vc]
In darkest deep Sussex as the sukebind writhed \\*
The Starkadders klettered their dishes and cried \\*
For the woodshed nemesis of Aunt Ada Doom \\*
At last stood revealed as \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[nh]
And she fell in love with that soldier so smart, \\*
The man from the military captured her heart. \\*
That day she was wed to a Heavy Dragoon, \\*
And Emily Smith became \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[un]
I fell to my knees by the pit in the sands \\*
I lifted the casket with trembing hands; \\*
But I found in the chest not a single dubloon \\*
Just a jade-inlaid bust of \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[gd]
``Is there life on that planet?'' the scientists wondered. \\*
There's a clue to be found in sequence 400; \\*
These are shots of the flank of a desolate dune, \\*
Emerging from which is \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[gd]
Jim's passion was seaweed in all of its guises. \\*
He'd gather up fragments of all shapes and sizes. \\*
With dulse and with wrack the walls he'd festoon \\*
in the ancestral dwelling of \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[vc]
Sleepless, sinuous, sliding and slow \\*
She slipped into the swamp where the water was low \\*
Slinking and swimming like a viper (Gaboon) \\*
The sinister shape of \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[nh]
Oh, ‘twas the Dread Lurgy, the outlook was poor. \\*
Just then a great doctor walked in at the door. \\*
Spike Milligan cured her – that prominent Goon. \\*
A lucky escape there, for \ravoon{}! \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[gd]
The captain looked up and turned white as a bone. \\*
He collapsed on the deck and emitted a groan. \\*
There on the iceberg with a monstrous harpoon \\*
Stood his sable–clad nemesis \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[nh]
Onto the scaffold the prisoner was led, \\*
Down onto the block she lowered her head, \\*
And the from her shoulders her head it was hewn. \\*
Thus died the traitorous \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[gd]
Though rotten tomatoes were winging my way, \\*
On the podium I was determined to stay. \\*
There was anger because I had dared to impugn \\*
The fascist agenda of \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[jm]
Not his Bond-baddie hairstyle nor his increasing girth, \\*
Nor the hats of his generals were free from her mirth\ldots{} \\*
But his patience wore thin, and Great Leader Jong-Un \\*
Fired a nuclear missile at \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[gd]
The aliens landed, of that there’s no doubt. \\*
Some folks were abducted; trees wandered about. \\*
The corn circles came, in the last days of June \\*
And they all showed the visage of \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[gd]
The quarryman’s find was a media sensation \\*
Now in the museum, on view to the nation \\*
It’s a large limestone slab from an ancient lagoon \\*
Containing a fossil of \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[ec]
I crawled to the summit one shadowy night \\*
I reached for the cairn; I crumpled with fright \\*
For prone on the corpse of a lumbering loon \\*
Black-clad and cackling, lay \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[gd]
The sale-of-work ladies were in a right state; \\*
the cake stall had suffered a terrible fate: \\*
the only thing left was a half macaroon, \\*
bearing the teeth-marks of \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[gd]
They rowed to the small uninhabited isle, \\*
The victim was drugged but would wake in a while. \\*
These intelligent folk were about to maroon \\*
The Republican Candidate \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[gd]
Wearing a cape and a weird pointy hat \\*
She tootled a nose-flute and hopped round a mat. \\*
With a loud clap of thunder began the monsoon,  \\*
For this was the rain-dance of \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[ec]
I fled to the beaches, sought solace in sand \\*
But peace was denied me: up struck the band \\*
And dancing the tango with Ban Ki Moon \\*
Was a banshee in Lycra: \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[un]
What decided the battle was a small group of peasants \\*
Brandishing pitchforks and dressed up as pheasants. \\*
And leading the charge of this motley platoon \\*
On a stampeding rhino rode \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[nh]
Into the night the Beast dragged her away. \\*
Her only defender too timid to stay: \\*
Abandoned to die, by that shameful poltroon, \\*
Unworthy defender of \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[gd]
The casino was crowded, the place was a riot, \\*
When all of a sudden the whole show went quiet; \\*
The hand was three sevens, a `royal pontoon', \\*
And it netted three million for \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[gd]
The mathematician repeatedly said \\*
He'd had nightmares where some THING had sat on his bed. \\*
This incubus looked like a vast mouldy prune; \\*
'Twas the Fourier transform of \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[un]
Across her pale profile the candlelight danced, \\*
Her measured tones held the party entranced: \\*
Who was the sire of that noble quadroon? \\*
Nobody knew save \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverseversion}[gd]
The spell had malfunctioned, the outcome was curious: \\*
He wasn't Prince Charming - in fact he was furious. \\*
He most closely resembled a rabid raccoon \\*
As he poured out invective at \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverseversion}

\begin{rverseversion}[nh]
Impaled on the antlers of a very large moose, \\*
Both eyes were pecked out by a savage grey goose, \\*
And her throat was torn out by a rabid raccoon, \\*
Thus ends the sad saga of \ravoon{}. \\!
\incrementstanza{}
\end{rverseversion}

\begin{rverse}[un]
The night was cold, and the weather was hailey \\

\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[gd]
After months on the trail I caught up with my foe. \\*

I confronted the outlaw \ravoon{}. \\!

\begin{rverse}[ad]
We set out from Prince Rupert on Highway sixteen; \\*
for the Yellowhead route is slow but serene \\*
We went by the North road, as in Saskatoon \\*
We hoped to revisit old \ravoon{} \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverseversion}[gd]
Our eponymous heroine sat on a shelf \\*
Composing much doggerel naming herself, \\*
When up spoke the ghost of Siegfried Sassoon: \\*
``These are crimes against literature, \ravoon{}'' \\!
\end{rverseversion}

\begin{rverseversion}[un]
Who dares to shatter the peace of the quad? \\

With passionate anguish was \ravoon{} \\!

\begin{rverseversion}[un]
The taps and the hinges were crusted with rust \\*

\end{rverseversion}

\begin{rverse}[ad]

And rose to do battle with \ravoon{} \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[jm]

From the tureen we ladled, with a large slotted spoon \\*
The mortal remains of \ravoon{}. \\!
\end{rverse}

\begin{rverse}[un]
The ogres were feasting, on Midsummer’s night \\*
